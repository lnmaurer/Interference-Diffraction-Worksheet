This is the worksheet that evolved from the one I use for teaching the interference and diffraction lab for UW-Madison's Physics 248 in Spring 2012. That class is the introductory E&M class for physics majors, but the worksheet could probably be modified to work for other classes.

The lab relies on the Interference Inference Interface, a wave simulation. That's available at

The main file is "InterferenceDiffraction Worksheet.lyx", a lyx document. See http://www.lyx.org/

That file contains notes with answers to the questions.
